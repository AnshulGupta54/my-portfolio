      <div className=" border-2 w-3/5">
        Hello, I'm Anshul Gupta, a recent college graduate driven by a deep
        passion for frontend development. With a keen eye for design and an
        insatiable curiosity, I'm committed to creating immersive digital
        experiences that resonate. Beyond visuals, I'm well-versed in data
        structures and algorithms, relishing the intricate dance of
        problem-solving. My aspiration is to evolve into a skilled software
        developer who seamlessly merges creativity with technical prowess. I
        believe that a solid grasp of both design aesthetics and coding logic is
        essential for crafting exceptional applications. With each line of code
        I write and each challenge I conquer, I'm stepping closer to this goal.
        As I embark on this journey, I'm fueled by the excitement of
        transforming concepts into functional software. The blend of innovation
        and precision, combined with a thirst for continuous learning, propels
        me forward. From frontend magic to coding complexity, I'm ready to
        explore, learn, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of software
        development.
